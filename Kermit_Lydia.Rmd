Lydia's first message, excellllent. 


This is Claire the collab master
- load tidyverse
- read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
- make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, seperated by the Gender column


```{r}
library(tidyverse)


kermit <- read_csv("Kermit.csv")


kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 4)+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist
```
